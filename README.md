The Final Countdown is a videogame I'm coding with python, I should say that it's been almost 2 years since I don't touch or interact with python code, the interest in this project started when I had an interview for a big company, they said I would do the technical interview with an OOP language, I said okay, I only been coding with JavaScript the last 2 years, it would be easier for me to interview in that language, they say okay, I've seen you used python before we're gonna do the interview in that language, I said, challenge accepted.

 didn't use many libraries for this, as I said, my objective with this project was to get a better understanding of python, I spent a good time coding this.
This is how the game looks like now.

I made the main menu, when the game is executed, you can see two buttons, you start the game, you have to select your warrior, once you selected your warrior, you can start fighting.

It's a very simple game, you move with the arrows, and with the space bar, you can shoot or hit your opponent. Each time the health bar of a warrior gets to zero, the player standing gets a point, if you reach 5 points you win. This is the first version of the game. I would like to do more, to improve it, add more features, and more objectives. I wish I find time to do it in the future.


I thought I should do the same here. *I'll make a game with python, this will help me a lot to remember the syntax and concepts of the language*, and this is how the project started.

I thought I wanted something like space invaders. So I started the project in that way direction.

I understood that the library pygame was the best for this kind of project. So I entered the website and started to check out how to start. I wanted the most simple thing. I have first done a square and made it move. in an 800x600 screen. It first looked like this:
